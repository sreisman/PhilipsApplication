Sample Web Application

https://github.com/sreisman/PhilipsApplication.git



This sample web application is a primitive tool which allows uploading of text files for for data analytics.  Currently, the only implemented feature counts the number of occurrences of each character.  

The D3 library is used to visualize the results as both a bar graph and pie chart.  The plan is for multiple text files to be uploaded and visualized against one another.  Some other features which can soon be added include parsing for keywords, as well as comparing the different words between files.

Although this is a toy project, similar analyses can be extended to useful applications, regarding important biological data.  

The project is built with Maven, and so ‘mvn install’ can be run in order to download all required dependency files.  

The project is currently hosted on github at
